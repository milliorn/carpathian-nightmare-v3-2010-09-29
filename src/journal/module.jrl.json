Over 200+ areas to explore.  Listed as a Hall of Fame NwNVault Gameworld, it is mainly Hak n' Slash and PvP.  ACN is the longest running PvP server with its original developer and owner in Neverwinter Nights.  It is also the longest running Legendary Level PvP server besides the original, Higher Ground.  ACN also has the most subraces in any PvP module.  ACN has the original PvP Score/Bounty Hunter System.  ACN was first launched in early 2005, but was completed in 2004.  Development started in 2003 originally as a Path of Ascension module.  The development of Path of Ascension ACN stems off from the days as a developer for the Ancient Warriors Clan, the original authors of Path of Ascension NwN.  After a year and lack of support, it was put on hold for over a year until ACN was born.  Module was then finished that year.  Wolfstar was the head Dungeon Master originally.  Elwoodini was the first host, serving for 4 years straight.  Qwen and Karyn Asher hosted BETA v2 of ACN later on, with Elwoodini hosting v2 full time after BETA ended.  Desi has relieved me (Milliorn) of forum/website work for almost 4 years now.  The only Dungeon Master to serve on both v1 and v2 of ACN was Wolfstar (their has been many that has come and gone).  The longest faithful member of ACN as a player and later on retired Dungeon Master, Durf, who has played ACN since its official launch, still plays to this day over five years later.  Many other members rival Durf's commitment such as the Legion of The Damned Guild, who has played ACN for nearly 5 years now."

Instead, they seek to harass other players, causing grief. In particular, they may use tools such as stalking, hurling insults, and exploiting unintended game mechanics. Griefing as a gaming play style is not simply any action that may be considered morally incorrect.\n\nThe use or abuse of a game mechanic that was not intended by the game's developers.\nThe inability of the victim to exact some means of retribution beyond utilizing similar unintended game mechanics.\nThe intended purpose of an act of griefing must be to negatively impact the gameplay of another person.\n\nPlayers will often consider the following actions to constitute griefing: kill stealing, spamming, team killing (or team wounding), team flashing, door or path blocking, ninja looting, spawn camping, and corpse camping.\n\n2.  No resurrecting a player after you PK them with intent to PK them again.\n\n3.  Do not hunt Players unless they have bounties.  You may PK them but excessive tracking a player that does not have a bounty can be considered Griefing, an Harrasment.\n\n4.  Do not Camp an area with intent to PvP UNLESS its a designated Camp Zone as listed in the journal.  You must keep transisting map to map (but not exploiting the transistion areas).\n\n5.  Never set a Trap, or go Hostile on a Spawn Point or Area Transistion.\n\n6.  No Pickpocketing in Arena (Script Enforced).\n\n7.  No Spamming Pickpocket anytime!  Once every 12 seconds).
